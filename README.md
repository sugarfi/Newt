# Newt
Newt is a small, C-like programming language that compiles to nasm assembly.
# Setting Up Newt
First, you must clone this repository.  
`git clone https://github.com/sugarfi/Newt.git`  
You will have a new directory `Newt/`.  
`cd` into it.  
`cd Newt/`  
*Linux users only*
To make Newt easier to run, make the `newt.py` file executable.  
`chmod +x newt.py`  
Now you can run `python3 newt.py yourfile.newt`, or, if you followed the previous step,`./newt.py yourfile.newt`.
